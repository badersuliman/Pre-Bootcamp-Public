<h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
<p>Basics JavaSmipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
    javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight 
    language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different 
    directions. javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node saver), it can
    be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
    <ul>
<li class="m">Variable Declaration</li><P> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine
    a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, an variable holds a value. All JavaScript 
    variables must identify with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. vas X;
    variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variable - our cup 
    can now has a coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = asignment
    operator assigns a value to a variable. vas x = 10; </P>
<li class="m">Data types</li><p> Data type are an important concept, to be able to operate on vadables you need to
    know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false: null- aka nothing,
    Number - 42 or 3.14159; String- "Coding Dojo Rocks! "; Array- [1, "Corting", 2, 'Dojo.];
    and Object - {fint_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</p>
    <li class="m">Conditionals</li><p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different 
        decisions - hitting different code blocks based on valuues or conditions that have been met.
        You can use conditional statements in your cede to accomplish this. There are the following 
        conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; 
        else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditim is false; else we execute 
        this block of code;There are many different kinds of loops in every pogramming language, but they all 
        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you 
        have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p>
        
            <li class="m">Function</li><P>Function are im encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will
                run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are 
                putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first 
                we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We 
                finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
                over and over and over again. </P>
